    clubguy "<client.fav_band> say they are "pivoting into their Ghost Punk era". From what I can tell, it's mostly a slight aesthetic shift into some grungier looks, but this "Ghost Awareness Concert" as they call it might actually end up doing some good, so who knows?"
    clubguy "Maybe if they keep that kind of thing up, they could go down in history."
    clubguy "Probably not though."
    clubguy "Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to be hosting them. If nothing else, they have a very dedicated fanbase. Good for business, and I enjoy using my club for something good every now and then."
    me "I see. I'm curious about this ghost awareness thing. What do they mean?"
    clubguy "As you might know, ghosts exist."
    me "Right."
    clubguy "But we like to pretend they don't."
    clubguy "Don't really treat them like normal members of society. Lots of arguments about them being incorporeal and how that somehow means they shouldn't be where physical being interact with physical objects."
    clubguy "<client.fav_band> thinks that bullshit, and I think they're pretty convincing on that front. Caf√©s can't have ectoplaceramic plates? They can't bake some ghost goods on the side? Sounds like bullshit to me."
    clubguy "The excuse is that they chose to stay apart from us living folk, but that's easily refuted by just asking them."
    clubguy "I guess that's what <client.fav_band> is trying to do with this concert. Just point out that our assumptions about ghosts are incorrect, and that's it's completely viable to have ghosts sharing their space with us."
